				<b>Welcome to Bar Harbor - One of the Best Places to Visit in Maine & New England</b>
				
				<br /><br /><p>The magic of Bar Harbor... romance, adventure, the rock-bound coast and soaring granite cliffs. From the stonewall-lined and tree-covered road leading you into our village, to the sweeping vistas from atop Cadillac Mountain, there is a special mystique to Bar Harbor. Nestled on the east side of Mt. Desert Island, surrounded by Acadia National Park, we have welcomed visitors for over a hundred years. And now we welcome you, too! Bar Harbor and Acadia National Park have a wide variety of offerings for visitors. There truly is something for everyone.
